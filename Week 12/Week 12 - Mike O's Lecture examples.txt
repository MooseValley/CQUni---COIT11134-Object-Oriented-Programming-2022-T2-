Subject: COIT11134 Week 11 and Week 12 tutorial and lab tasks
 
Hi Colleagues,

I am not delivering lectures on the scheduled topics in Week 11 and Week 12. I will discuss the final project in the lectures instead.

Students don't need to complete the usual tutorial and lab tasks in these two weeks. Please help students with their final project in these sessions.  

Regards,
Salahuddin



---------------------------------------------------------------
Week 12 = TOTAL NO SHOW.
No-one came to class.
(3 enrolled: only 1 student attended regularly anyway.  1 has not been to a single class.  1 has attended approx half the classes).


PUBLIC HOLIDAY today (Mon, 3-Oct-2022)
Classes held at usual time (on public holiday).  
Was going to discuss this and see if students wanted to move class in Week 11 - but no-one came to class.
=> No vote => No class time move.
Students emailed approx 1 hour prior to class to confirm class is still on.

EOF.
