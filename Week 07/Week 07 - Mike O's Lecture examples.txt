**********************
File I/O:
**********************

Many ways to READ files
	Scanner
	BufferedReader
	InputStreams
	:::

Many ways to WRITE files
	Formatter
	BufferedeWriter
	OutputStreams
	:::


Pseudo Code
WRITE
   try
	Open a file for output
	while more data to write (looping through an ArrayList, etc)
		write data
	Close File
   catch (exception(s) ...)


READ
   try
	Open a File for input (auto create)
	while file has more data
		read data
		create objects (Epmployee, ....)
		add to an array list ??
	Close file
   catch (exception(s) ...)


Pros and Cons

Plain Text ****
Binary


Typed Files
	File of Employee
	File of ArrayList<Employee>

Random Access Files



How do you format the file's data ???

CSV
	surname, address, age, customer notes, ....

TSV



String[] fields = scanner.nextLine().split(",");


Recommendation for now:
	one field per line

name
address
age

::::
name
address
age

::::



**********************
Exception Handling:
**********************

try
catch
finally
throws


UnChecked Exceptions
	write whatever Java code you like, don't need to handle Exceptions (no try catch)
	division by zero
	array out of bound

Checked Exceptions
	Java is so worried about you using these Java commands that it will NOT let you them unless
	you use Exception Handling (try, catch, ...)
	Your code will NOT compile unless you handle the exceptions
	File I/O
	Network I/O
	Database I/O
	:::



**********************
JOptionPane
**********************
	Message Dialogs
	Confirmation Dialogs - OK, Cancel, Yes/No
	Input Dialog

JOptionPane.showMessageDialog (null, "message here");

String inputStr = JOptionPane.showInputDialog (null, "Enter Name:");

int result = JOptionPane.showConfirmationDialog (null, "Exit ?  Are your sure", JOptionPane.OK_CANCEL_OPTION);

if (result == JOptionPane.OK_OPTION)


EOF.
